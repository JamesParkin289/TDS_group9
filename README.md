## Title
Malignant Melanoma Prediction Using Time-Stamped Hospital Admissions in UK Biobank Participants

## About
Our project is focused on malignant melanoma prediction using machine learning techniques. We aimed to explore the use of time-windowed comorbidities in addition to demographics and  based on a triplet-paired case control matching. Full details of this and the results are as described in our report and presentation (in the Documents folder).

## Scripts
These are organized into 4 folders for your reading:
1. Data Wrangling
2. Case Control Selection and Windowing
3. Descriptive Analysis and Vizualization
4. Modelling 

## Results
* Complex and non-linear relationships between predictors and outcome of melanoma are able to be modelled with high accuracy and low false negative rates, with the use of tree-based models and neural networks 
* Time windowing provided marginal benefits to the predictive accuracy of tree-based models and neural networks. The mean gain in AUC ranged from 0.021 to 0.024.
